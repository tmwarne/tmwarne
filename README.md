- 👋 Hi, I’m @tmwarne
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, improving my technical skills, and ultimately becomming a programmer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.  I've mostly focused on backend programming, so I'm going to pivot to front end for the short term.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting and challanging with a great community.
- 📫 Message me on here for the time being.
